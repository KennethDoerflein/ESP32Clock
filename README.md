# ESP32-S3 WiFi Clock

This repository contains the firmware for a feature-rich, Wi-Fi connected smart clock powered by an ESP32-S3 microcontroller. It features a large 3.5" color TFT display, a web-based interface for easy configuration, automatic time synchronization, and environmental sensing.

## Features

- **Large Color Display**: A 3.5" 480x320 color TFT display provides a clear and vibrant user interface.
- **Web-Based Configuration**: A mobile-friendly web UI allows for easy setup and configuration without needing to re-flash the firmware.
- **WiFi & AP Mode**: Connects to your local WiFi network or starts its own Access Point (`ESP32-Clock-Setup`) if credentials are not set.
- **Automatic Time Sync**: An onboard Real-Time Clock (DS3231) with battery backup keeps accurate time, synchronized daily with NTP internet servers.
- **Environment Sensing**: A BME280 sensor provides live temperature and humidity readings on the display.
- **Smart Brightness Control**: The display backlight can be controlled manually via the web UI or set to an automatic day/night schedule.
- **Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates**: Update the clock's firmware directly from the web interface, either by uploading a binary file or pulling the latest release directly from GitHub.
- **Persistent Storage**: All settings (WiFi credentials, display preferences) are saved to the ESP32's internal flash storage using LittleFS.

## Usage Guide

### First-Time Setup

1.  On the first boot, or if WiFi credentials are not configured, the clock will start a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP). The SSID will be **`ESP32-Clock-Setup`**.
2.  Connect to this network from your phone or computer.
3.  Open a web browser and navigate to the clock's static IP address, which is **`http://192.168.4.1`**. This address is fixed when the clock is in AP mode.

### Web Interface

The web interface provides access to all the clock's settings.

#### 1. WiFi Configuration

- Enter the SSID and password for the selected network and click **"Save & Connect"**.
- The device will save the credentials and restart to connect to your WiFi network. On success, the display will show the new IP address assigned by your router. You can now access the web interface from this new IP address on your local network.

#### 2. Clock Settings

- **Auto Brightness**: Check this box to enable a time-based schedule (bright during the day, dim at night).
- **Manual Brightness**: If Auto Brightness is disabled, use this slider to set a fixed brightness level.
- **24-Hour Format**: Switch the clock display between 12-hour (with AM/PM) and 24-hour format.
- **Use Celsius (Â°C)**: Switch the temperature display between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

#### 3. Firmware Update

- **Manual Upload**: Click "Choose File" to select a `firmware.bin` file from your computer and click "Upload" to start the update.
- **GitHub Update**: Click the "Check for Updates from GitHub" button to automatically fetch and install the latest firmware release from this repository.
